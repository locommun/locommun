    title: " FAQs "
    locommun_head:  "Was ist Locommun?"
    locommun_text: "Locommun ist ein lokales soziales Netzwerk in welchem sich Gemeinschaften zusammenfinden. Bei einer Gemeinschaft gibt es Aktivitäten, welche über Locommun organisiert werden können. Wenn du dieser Gemeinschaft beitreten willst, kannst auch Du Aktivitäten veranstallten und über Locommun organisieren und andere informieren! "
    how: "Wie geht das?"
    how_text: "Eigentlich funktioniert Locommun nicht anders als die guten alten Aushänge an Pinnwänden, schwarzen Brettern, Litfaßsäulen, oder wie die Dinger noch heißen. Ein Aushang bei Locommun (bei uns heißt das Aktivität) ist digital und analog zugleich. Du erkennst ihn an dem Locommun-Logo und einem QR-Code. Ein QR-Code sieht ähnlich wie ein Barcode aus. Du kannst ihn mit deinem Smartphone abfotografieren und er führt dich dann zur richtigen Seite. Nur wenn du einen QR-Code abfotografiert hast, kannst du auch auf die jeweilige Pinnwand schreiben (wenn du kein Smartphone besitzt geht das auch mit einem Code den du abschreiben kannst). Das klingt kompliziert, aber es ist kinderleicht. Probier's doch einfach mal aus!"
    local: "Nur lokal?"
    local_text: "Das wäre ja langweilig. Natürlich ist es auch möglich, sich zwischen verschiedenen Kiezen, in verschiedenen Städten oder Ländern zu vernetzen. Sucht euch einfach einen Paten vor Ort und schon könnt ihr auch dort Aktivitäten unternehmen. Zum Beispiel vor dem nächsten Urlaub einfach mal vor Ort fragen, was so läuft. Oder umgekehrt: übernehmt eine Patenschaft für jemanden, der neu in der Stadt ist!"
    beta: "Beta"
    beta_text_1: "Locommun befindet sich noch in der Beta-Phase. Das bedeutet, dass du dir gerade eine erste Vorabversion ansiehst. Wir haben aber noch viele Ideen, um Locommun noch besser zu machen. Deshalb schrauben wir im Hintergrund fleißig weiter. Wenn du uns beim Arbeiten zuschauen willst, schau' mal auf " 
    beta_text_2:  "vorbei. Wir hoffen, dass dir Locommun schon jetzt gefällt und du bald wieder vorbeikommst."
    github: "GitHub"
    godfather: "Patenschaft"
    godfather_text: "Wenn du gerade umgezogen bist, bald umziehen wirst, oder einfach so in eine neue Stadt kommst, kannst du dort bei einer beliebigen Gemeinschaft ein Paten-Gesuch erstellen. All Diejenigen, welche bei dieser Gemeinschaft aktiv sind, sehen dieses Paten-Gesuch und können eine Patenschaft mit dir annehmen. Du hast dann die Möglichkeit mit dem Paten zu kommunizieren. Der Pate kann dir bei den verschiedensten Dingen behilflich sein! Also wenn du neu an einen Ort kommst, schau doch einfach mal, ob in deiner nähe eine Gemeinschaft ist, auf der du ein Paten-Gesuch erstellen kannst."
